Our Story
PianoBuzz Studios believes playing piano is for everyone! Ages 5+ have a blast learning to read music & play by ear through a unique, game-based program. Say “no” to traditional piano lessons where learning to play is hard and home practice is a struggle (and you dread going to that next lesson). Say “yes” to learning to play the easy, super fun way (where you can’t wait to go back for more). Ask for a free first lesson to experience the musical fun for yourself!

Our Story
We moved to our property in 2018. With a love for horses, we decided to share the riding experience with others. Learn to be confident, overcome fear, set and respect boundaries, the value of a hard day's work and so much more. Note, that none of that is truly possible without help from the Lord. Now, 5 years later, we have not only expanded our operation but our family too. All glory to God. We look forward to continuing to expand with a garden market and farm fresh chicken eggs some day.

Our Story
By utilizing Chiropractic Medicine, Physical Therapy, Regenerative Medicine and MANY manual therapies we can handle almost any physical problem.
We approach our cases from a mindset of, ""How can I quickly, safely and affordably help each patient feel better and stay healthy?""
@ IPM New Lenox we don't ""fix"" our patients. We TEACH our patients about their injuries, and then we TEACH them how to fix their injuries.
Our empowering approach to physical wellness is unparalleled.

Our Story
Located on County Farm Road, Nova Rehabilitation Acupuncture & Chiropractic is like no other medical or chiropractic office. The clinic environment is upbeat, tranquil and comfortable. Decorated in calming colors, we do not have bright lights or stressed staff members. As soon as you enter our office, you will notice a peaceful and easy feeling in the air. More than an upbeat ambient vibe, this is the modus operandi—your time here is about you–not us, and we are aware that your time is precious.

HoneVille™ would love to print your t-shirts. I have a Brother GTX and can print in every color on the CYMK scale at no extra charge. I'd love to do your church shirts, camp shirts, club shirts and more. I'd prefer orders in the 15 to 300 range but won't turn down work. I'm self-employed, married 30+ years, with 2 grown up children. Had 4 foster kids, all related but they went home. You can visit my one Ebay at HoneVille.com

Our Story
At FS&S, we are committed to giving you back what pain has taken away—one visit at a time. We use a combination of corrective chiropractic care, Active Release Techniques, muscle activation, spinal curve restoration, and dry needling to help you feel like yourself again—probably even BETTER!
We are a Christian-owned business, where honoring God with our excellence for the sake of our patients is at the core of what we do. We both celebrate conservative values, and can’t wait to serve you!
